# Employee DB [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

I like the name because it's easy to remember and it (soft) rhymes three times, but EDB is more employee management tool than simple database.
A SQL schema and seed data are included, but the meat of the application is a simple command line interface written in JavaScript utilizing NodeJS.
Selected a command from the main menu prompts the user with a series of questions and saves their answers to be passed into the database, saving the user the burden of handling SQL queries themselves.
While other applications might be able to perform similar functions, EDB offers a lightweight application and nostalgic aesthetic.
